# Random-Forest-Regressor
We have used Random Forest Regressor Model to predict the target value petrol consumption in the dataset which has four independent variables - [Petrol_tax, Average_income, Paved_Highways,	Population_Driver_licence(%)]
You find the dataset inside the data folder as petrol_consumption.csv or you can get the dataset from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVmGNx6cbfvRHC_DvF12ZL3wGLSHD9f_/view
DataShape
Missing Values/Duplicated Values: No missing or duplicate values
Variables: All are Continuous Numerical Variables
